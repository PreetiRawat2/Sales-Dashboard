# Sales-Dashboard
🚀 Unlock Dynamic Power BI Reports with Custom Measures & Parameters! 📊

Struggling to keep your reports focused on key metrics? Custom measures and parameters can transform your dashboards into interactive, KPI-driven tools!

Here’s how I did it in this report:

✅ Core KPIs: Total Profits, Total Quantity Sold, and Total Sales.

✅ Measures First: Created dedicated DAX measures for each KPI to ensure accuracy and reusability.

✅ Dynamic Parameters: Bundled these measures into interactive parameters, enabling users to:
- Switch visuals on the fly 📈
- Filter data with slicers 🔍

Visual used are - 

↗️Line Chart
↗️KPI cards
↗️Donut Chart
↗️Matrix Visual
↗️Ribbon Chart

The result? A user-driven experience where stakeholders can interact with data instead of staring at static charts!
